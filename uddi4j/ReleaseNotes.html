<BLOCKQUOTE>Major contribution by HP to the project as

<H4>1.0.3 released 06/26/2001</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This release contains a significant bug fix.
Users of previous releases are strongly encouraged
to upgrade. <BR>
Corrected problem incorrecting interpreting
'name' attributes contained at multiple levels
when invoking save requests. <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>1.0.2 released 03/28/2001</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The getDescriptionStrings methods have been
removed from all classes that had them. They
have been replaced with getDefaultDesriptionString
method.<BR>
<BR>
The getDescriptionStrings method was misleading.
Each string in the returned vector represented
a different language, yet there was no way
to figure out what language each string was
for. getDefaultDescriptionString returns
the default (english) string.<BR>
<BR>
To obtain all the descriptions, use the getDescriptionVector
method. This returns Description objects
which contain a language attribute.<BR>
<BR>
Some fixes have been checked in to required
field constructs that accepted Vectors of
Strings. This does not affect their signatures.
Affected classes are: DeleteBinding, DeleteBusiness,
DeleteService, DeleteTModel, GetBindingDetail,
GetBusinessDetail, GetBusinessDetailExt,
GetServiceDetail, GetTModelDetail, TModelBag.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>1.0.1 released 02/16/01</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Required fields constructors corrected for
some objects.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Initial submission by IBM of UDDI4J to open
source community on Developerworks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>1.0 beta release 11/13/2000</H4>
