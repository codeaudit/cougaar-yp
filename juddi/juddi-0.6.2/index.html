<h3>jUDDI Overview</h3>
        <p>jUDDI (pronounced &quot;Judy&quot;) is an open source implementation 
          of version 2 of the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration 
          (UDDI) specification written in Java.</p>
        <p>More information and the latest release can be found at <a href="http://www.juddi.org/">jUDDI.org</a>.</p>
        <h4>About UDDI</h4>
        <p>UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery and Integration. The 
          UDDI specification enables businesses to quickly, easily, and dynamically 
          find and transact with one another. UDDI enables a business to (i) describe 
          its business and its services, (ii) discover other businesses that offer 
          desired services, and (iii) integrate with these other businesses. UDDI 
          enables companies to publish how they want to conduct business on the 
          web, potentially fueling growth of Web services-based electronic commerce. 
        <p>UDDI benefits businesses of all sizes by creating a global, platform-independent, 
          open architecture for describing businesses and services, discovering 
          those businesses and services, and integrating businesses using the 
          Internet.
        <p>The UDDI project is a sweeping industry initiative. The project creates 
          a platform-independent, open framework for describing services, discovering 
          businesses, and integrating business services using the Internet, as 
          well as an operational registry that is available today.</p>
        <p>UDDI is the first truly cross-industry effort driven by all major platform 
          and software providers, as well as marketplace operators and e-business 
          leaders. These technology and business pioneers are acting as the initial 
          catalysts to quickly develop UDDI and related technologies.</p>
        <p>The UDDI project takes advantage of WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C) 
          and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards such as Extensible 
          Markup Language (XML), and HTTP and Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. 
          Additionally, cross platform programming features are addressed by adopting 
          early versions of the proposed Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 
          known as XML Protocol messaging specifications found at the W3C Web 
          site. The UDDI protocol is the building block that will enable businesses 
          to quickly, easily and dynamically find and transact with one another 
          using their preferred applications.</p>
